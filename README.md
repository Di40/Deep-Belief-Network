# DeepBeliefNetwork

In this project, we aim to investigate the process of visual concept learning with DBNs using simulations and analyses on FashionMNIST dataset. Visual concept learning is the process of acquiring knowledge about the visual features associated with different categories of objects. To do this, we will perform different tasks, specifically:

*   Analyze internal representations using hierarchical clustering (dendograms) and feature visualization methods (receptive fields). 
*   Use linear read-outs to test the model's representations at different levels of the hierarchy.
*   Visualize confusion matrices and psychometric curves to examine the model's performance under varying noise levels.
*   Evaluate the model's robustness against adversarial attacks.

Finally, we will discuss the details of our implementation, the motives behind our choices, and critically evaluate our results.
