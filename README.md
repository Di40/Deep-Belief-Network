# Deep Belief Network (DBN)

This is a school project completed for the *Cognition and Computation* course at the University of Padova.

In this project, I investigated the process of **visual concept learning** with **DBN**s using simulations and analyses on *FashionMNIST* dataset. Visual concept learning is the process of acquiring knowledge about the visual features associated with different categories of objects. To do this, I performed different tasks, specifically:

*   Analysis of internal representations using hierarchical clustering (**dendograms**) and feature visualization methods (**receptive fields**). 
*   Testing the model's representations at different levels of the hierarchy using linear read-outs.
*   Visualizing confusion matrices and psychometric curves to examine the model's performance under varying **perturbations**.
*   Evaluating the model's robustness against **adversarial attacks**.

Finally, I discussed the details of the implementation, the motives behind my choices, and critically evaluated the obtained results.
